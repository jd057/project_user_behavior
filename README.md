# project_user_behavior
Analyzed 5 days worth of information of user behavior in a webpage designed to help you rent high-end, furnished apartments in various cities for longer stays than your average Airbnb (3 months minimum). There are 1.5 million events recorded in that timeframe, and a lot of answers to uncover.
Created and examined KPIs such as number of different sessions, users, the time of the sessions, the conversions, most and least popular events, average events by sessions and user, top X visitors, what is common behaviour when we have a purchase vs not, and much more.
