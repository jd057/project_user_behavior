# project_user_behavior
Analyzed 5 days worth of user behavior in a web that helps you rent high-end, furnished apartments for longer stays. There are 1.5 million events recorded in that timeframe. 
Looked at KPIs such as number of different sessions, users, the time of the sessions, the conversions, most and least popular events, average events by sessions and user, etc.
